3) Next, chmod ecommerce_shopping_cart_software/includes/configure.php and chmod ecommerce_shopping_cart_software/admin/includes/configure.php to 444.
4) Chmod 777 the /images folder.
5) If your web server uses a different directory for SSL / https protected files, repeat steps 1-4 for this directory.
6) Change your admin username and password by sending an http request to /install/change_password.php via your web browser, using the following query string parameters: db_username [Database Username], db_password [Database Password], db_server [Database Server], db_database [Database Name] ). 

Example:
http://www.yourdomain.com/ecommerce_shopping_cart_software/install/change_password.php?db_username=user&db_password=pass&db_server=localhost&db_database=ecommerce_shopping_cart_software

If you don't do this it will be easy for anyone with a little software knowledge to log in and edit your store's settings.   This feature will most likely be incorporated into the admin UI very soon.  If you can't figure out how to do it, try using the windows installer for unix.
